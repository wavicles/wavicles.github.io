This repository is for my GSoC github page <http://wavicles.github.io>

The site gives information about my work for Google Summer of Code with mentor organization FOSSASIA <http://pslab.fossasia.org>

For GSoC my work was related to developing open source tech for science experiments using Open Source tools like ExpEYES and PSLab
* The PSLab project is inspired from ExpEYES  <http://expeyes.in>
* FOSSASIA is supporting development and promotion of ExpEYES project since 2014 mainly through Google Summer of Code
* The current work is a part of my GSoC-16 project
